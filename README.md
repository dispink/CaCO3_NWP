# CaCO3_NWP

It is a cooperative project with JC aiming to build a model for predicting CaCO<sub>3</sub>, TOC, and TC using spectra produced by Avaatech.
The model is training by the bulk measurements (low resolution: several centimeters to meters) and the spectra (high resolution: 1 cm) provided by JC. These data are measured from the sediment cores taken at North-West Pacific Ocean.
